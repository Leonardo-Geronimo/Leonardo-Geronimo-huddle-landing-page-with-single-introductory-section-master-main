- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

With this challenge, I was able to develop unique techniques for a better job of positioning elements on the screen.



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>


    <ul class="social-links">
      <li><a href="#"><i class="fa-brands fa-facebook-f"></i></a></li>
      <li><a href="#"><i class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i></a></li>
      <li><a href="#"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a></li>
    </ul>
```
```css
.redes .social-links .fa-brands {
  place-content: center;
}
```


### Continued development

During the construction of the project, I had problems with the styling of some items. That's when I started using (rem) and I got very accurate results in my alignments.
